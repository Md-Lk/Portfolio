# API and database functional design for an eCommerce application

### Preview:

Work was done in a group of 3, with ~80-90% of the part shown developed individually. Coding relied on GenAI (Claude, Gemini), and the supervisory process involved:
- Defining project structure based on functional requirements (7 .py files, each with specific database functions)
- Specifying database structure using ERDs (entity relationship diagrams, made via plantUML)
- Thorough manual unit testing of function behavior and project QA (in ~5x3h group sessions)

The image shows successful integration with Postman, through which the app is writing (POSTing) new items in the SQL database, with details further below.
